# Plotly.js for Time-series Chart

This demo project aims to learn the use of Plotly and the methods: AJAX and WebSocket, to transmit data between the client and server.
The purpose is to use Plotly inside a micro controller, STM32 for example, for showing data from ADC.
Hopefully, this will reduce time in the development of an external GUI software.

The project might be run on Node.js so that I have made a installation script `make_venv.sh` included as well; and, 
then, the `run.sh` is only the command for starting the demo.
